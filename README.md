## üåô Silent Memories

Silent Memories is a WIP pixel RPG/puzzle game.  
**Currently playable as a demo in the Godot engine!**

You wake up in your old kindergarten, unable to speak.  
Luckily your best friend is here, but they can't see anything.  
Will you be able to find the way out?  

I am currently working on assets and the game's basic functions.

## üñ•Ô∏è Software used
Aseprite (https://www.aseprite.org/)  
Godot (https://godotengine.org/license/) 
### Plugins
Dialogic 2 (https://github.com/dialogic-godot/dialogic)

**My goal is to have a fully functional game that others can enjoy.**  

**Notes:**  
- Tilesets are drawn on multiple frames of the same .aseprite file  
- The game can only be run through the Godot Engine at the moment. Since it is not complete, expect bugs!
