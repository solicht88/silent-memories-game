## Silent Memories

Silent Memories is a WIP pixel RPG/puzzle game.  

You wake up in your old kindergarten, unable to speak.  
Luckily your best friend is here, but they can't see anything.  
Will you two be able to find the way out?

Currently working on assets and the basic functions of the game.  

## Software used
Aseprite (https://www.aseprite.org/)  
Godot (https://godotengine.org/license/)  

The end goal is to have a fully functional game that others can enjoy.
