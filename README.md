## Silent Memories

Silent Memories is a WIP pixel RPG/puzzle game.  

You wake up in your old kindergarten, unable to speak.  
Luckily your best friend is here, but they can't see anything.  
Will you be able to find the way out?  

Right now, I am working on assets and the game's basic functions.  

## Software used
Aseprite (https://www.aseprite.org/)  
Godot (https://godotengine.org/license/)  

The end goal is to have a fully functional game that others can enjoy.  

**Notes:**  
- Tilesets are drawn on multiple frames of the same .aseprite file  
- Game can currently only be run through the Godot Engine. Since it is not complete, expect errors!
