"The Fox and The Grapes" by Aesop
On a bright, sunny day, a hungry fox was walking in the forest.
The fox stumbled upon a bunch of grapes, hanging high on a vine.
Though he jumped and leaped with all his might, the fox was unable to reach the grapes.
"I do not need these grapes," the fox exclaimed in frustration. "They must be unripe and sour!"
The fox then left the bunch of grapes behind, ignoring the way his stomach rumbled.
char_1 (Neutral): I remember this story.
char_1: The poor fox could not obtain the grapes, so it tricked itself into believing the grapes were sour.
char_1: I wonder what happend to the fox afterwards.
